    "Program ini menjalankan analisa pada kumpulan CSV yang merupakan hasil output proses ekstraksi data di program sebelumnya. Analisa ini bertujuan untuk menghitung nilai rata-rata dari jumlah frame sequence di setiap data CSV tersebut. Hasil analisa ini akan digunakan sebagai limit sequence yang bisa membantu proses training algoritma LSTM agar lebih konsisten dan akurat. "
